# Linux Fundementals
  Next, Linux was always one of thos os's I wanted to learn but did not where to start. Starting this class showed me so much about it, I will list a few things I found very interesting about it.

  1. You can use a Linux essentially from anywhere as long as you have a connection, and an AWS instance running.
  2. So much more customization is allowed with Linux, you can essentially make a whole new os.
  3. Linux allows you to use alot of different program packages, without having to manually install to a personal computer. For example, mySQL used in database management.
