# Cloud Infrastructre

  Cloud Infrastuctre is one of those topics, where it looks super scary at first but is amazing once you get it down. To start, it is perfect for mantianing code across different systems and networks. There is not alot you can do in terms of scalability in the modern world without it. In closing, I was able to learn how to properly configure a cloud server along with a network (using ports) that allows for security but also flexibilty.
