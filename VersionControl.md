# Version Control
  Going into devops I had already learned quite a bit about version control already using Git. However, it is still a **NEED TO KNOW**.
  Version control in short is needed for any type of programmer, as it used to keep live changes from in-pending changes.

# Linux Fundementals
  Next, Linux was always one of thos os's I wanted to learn but did not where to start. Starting this class showed me so much about it, I will list a few things I found very interesting about it.

  1. You can use a Linux essentially from anywhere as long as you have a connection, and an AWS instance running.
  2. So much more customization is allowed with Linux, you can essentially make a whole new os.
  3. Linux allows you to use alot of different program packages, without having to manually install to a personal computer. For example, mySQL used in database management.

# Cloud Infrastructre

  Cloud Infrastuctre is one of those topics, where it looks super scary at first but is amazing once you get it down. To start, it is perfect for mantianing code across different systems and networks. There is not alot you can do in terms of scalability in the modern world without it. In closing, I was able to learn how to properly configure a cloud server along with a network (using ports) that allows for security but also flexibilty.

# Containerization 

  Easily my favorite topic we covered in this course. The ability to contain code in containers that you can tailor for different needs is amazing. For example, if using mySQL collecting data across different sources. You can redirect all of that data to save to a singular volume storage inside its own container. Not to mention using containers to communicate on a network, could be a major benefit working in a large corporation. Transfering different data out of containers all inside of one network!
